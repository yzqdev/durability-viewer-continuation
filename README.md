## Mod description

Show item durability numbers in color (green/white/yellow/red) depending on items state Items that are at almost 100% show damage, not durability. For example, your diamond pick that was used 5 times will show -5, not 1556. Great when you're using the mending enchantment to fix your stuff and don't know the exact number you want to reach Also show number of empty inventory slots; know at a glance if you can continue mining or should return to your chest Shows the amount of time for your buffs to run out so you don't have to press E to check whether that water breathing potion lasts for another minute (can be turned off in options) Play a warning sound when your item is about to break; stop losing your Efficiency V pick to not looking at the GUI.

It has curios interaction, you can see your curios item's durability.

Default it will show all you inventory's item with a durability number on it, you can turn it off in the settings.
